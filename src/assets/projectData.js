I was required to pair up with three different group members to build an app that relied upon a web A.P.I to function. We all contributed to aspects of this app, but I was specifically tasked with incorporating local storage to it. You can an example of this at the bottom of the app, in the Past Search box.

    "description": "The aim for this project was to develop a functional and professional Read Me generator tool. The app allows users to answer a series of questions to fill out a description, installation instructions, a license, and more. The app then takes this information and places it in a professional tempelate. This tool cuts down on time spent coding in markdown after a project, homework, or even potentially when a new app is completed. In its current state, I think the app is better used to do most of the work that a read me requires, then going back over the generated file to fill in additional information by hand.",

These logs would be saveable to browser, so that if needed, a user can close out of this page and refer back to it when needed. It also displays the current time and date at the top of the page, and color codes each time block to easily identify what event is coming up in a day.",
