I was required to pair up with three different group members to build an app that relied upon a web A.P.I to function. We all contributed to aspects of this app, but I was specifically tasked with incorporating local storage to it. You can an example of this at the bottom of the app, in the Past Search box.

    "description": "The aim for this project was to develop a functional and professional Read Me generator tool. The app allows users to answer a series of questions to fill out a description, installation instructions, a license, and more. The app then takes this information and places it in a professional tempelate. This tool cuts down on time spent coding in markdown after a project, homework, or even potentially when a new app is completed. In its current state, I think the app is better used to do most of the work that a read me requires, then going back over the generated file to fill in additional information by hand.",
