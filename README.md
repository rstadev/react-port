  ## Description
  This was a project in the Georgia Tech Bootcamp program. It is meant to e a functional react portfolio website, with dynamic rendering and react technology. This app is not meant to be viewed in a professional sense, and should be seen more as a hobbyist app. I would like to incorporate a background image between the header and the footer, but nothing I do will take a section to the footer and directly stop it there, for whatever reason. Also, I cannot get the image url linked properly and rendered dynamically in the portfolio page, and I have tried everything I can think of to get it working, but all only one project card component is used multiple times on the portfolio page and different info is generated on each card.
